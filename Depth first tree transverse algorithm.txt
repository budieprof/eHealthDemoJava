DEPTH FIRST TREE TRANVERSE ALGORITHM.

1, Create a method (TreeTranveral(node a, list nodeList)) that accept a parent node, and a static/reference type empty node list.
2, inside the method, add the node to the list,
3, Get all the children node of the parent node, and for each child node, make a recursive call of the method to take in the child node and the node list.
